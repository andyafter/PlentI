Web application for amazing plans of holidays!
** Settings
PlentI relies extensively on environment settings which will not work with Apache/mod_wsgi setups.
** Getting up and running
*** Basics
The steps below will get you up and running with a local development environment. We assume you have the following installed:
- MongoDB
- NodeJS
- gulp(betterinstalled globally)
Make sure you have the folder ~/data/db~ in your root directory and is writable. And make sure that you ran ~mongod~ in some terminal.

Install dependencies from the project root directory:
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
$ npm install
#+END_SRC

You can run the website by running:
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
gulp serve
#+END_SRC

Run the backend only:
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
$ npm start
#+END_SRC


*** TODO 
Write scripts for requirement installation.
